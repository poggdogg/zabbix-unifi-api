# Zabbix Template for Unifi Site Manager API v1.0

How to use:
* Get an account and API key setup at https://developer.ui.com/site-manager-api/gettingstarted/
* Import the template
* Fill in the API key
* Assign to a host that will be running the queries (I added my Zabbix server)
* Sites should auto-discover and alert.

### Based off initial work by [Chises] from an earlier version of the Unifi API (https://github.com/chises/zabbix-unifi)
